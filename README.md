This project enhances Car Dheko's customer experience by deploying a streamlined ML model to predict used car prices accurately. Leveraging a dataset with historical prices across multiple cities, we perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and model optimization to deliver reliable predictions. The final model is deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit application, allowing users to get real-time price estimates with ease.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

**Objective:**  
Transform customer interactions and streamline pricing decisions by building a machine learning model that predicts used car prices based on detailed car features.

**Scope:**  
Analyze data from multiple cities with features such as car make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The end goal is to deploy a tool that predicts prices accurately based on these attributes and is accessible to both customers and sales representatives through an interactive web app.
